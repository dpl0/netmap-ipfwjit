1 BUG: Firewall can't compile code.
	Comments: We think this happens due to the change in the LLVM version we're
	using now. During the last summer, I used devel/llvm-devel, and we're now
	settling with LLVM 3.5, and I'll probably end up porting to the C API.
	Error message(s):
		* (LLVM ERROR: Target does not support MC emission!)
		* () (empty errsrt after creating ExecutionEngine).
		* (LLVM ERROR: Inline asm not supported by this streamer because we
			don't have an asm parser for this target) When using
			InitializeNativeTargetAsmParser().
		* KERNEL PANIC: Happens when at initialization we call:
			InitializeNativeTarget();
			InitializeNativeTargetAsmPrinter();
			InitializeNativeTargetAsmParser();
			LLVMLinkInMCJIT();
			This is not expected at all. We're supposedly playing at userland.


	TEST: LLVM build is broken.
		PROOF: Use same LLVM build with another compiler using MCJIT as well.
		DISPROVEN: Another LLVM project works perfectly
			(CompileTeaching/MysoreScript).

	TEST: Final IR is wrong.
		PROOF: Dump IR into a file and compile with clang's assembler.
			DISPROVEN: Not needed having a module verfier.
		PROOF: Use the runtime code checker. (.setVerifyModule(true))
			DISPROVEN: Even when checking the module, it doesn't work.

	TEST: Function and module optimization are the culprit.
		PROOF: Just do not perform any optimization. I also didn't deleted
		"void_function" a function used so that we can use an initial bitcode
		with the needed structs and type information.
		DISPROVEN: Not working despite change.

	TEST: LLVM is initialized inadequately.
		PROOF: Perform the minimal initialization, see if it works.
			DISPROVEN: It doesn't work this way.
		PROOF: Myscript is correct, therefore, we can debug its initialization
			and perform it ourselves in the same way.
			Comment: Instead of run a debugger, I'm trying to use something to
				get a function call graph. That should do the work too.
				I ended up copying the code from MysoreScript after searching for
				too long.
			DISPROVEN: Still getting the "Target does not support MC emission!"
				error.

	TEST: Project is not build adequatelly.
		Comment: This has been double checked now.
		PROOF: Compile a different compiler and compare results.
		DISPROVEN: Changed the Makefile to reflect the compiling and linking
			process of another working compiler (CompileTeaching/MysoreScript).
			It works perfectly.


2 BUG: Kernel panic when calling some LLVM functions. (See BUG 1)
